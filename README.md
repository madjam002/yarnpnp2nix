# yarnpnp2nix

Yet another way of packaging Node applications with Nix. Unlike alternatives, this plugin is built for performance (both speed and disk usage) and aims to be unique with the following goals:

- NPM dependencies should be stored in the /nix/store individually rather than in a huge "node_modules" derivation. Zip files should be used where possible to work well with Yarn PNP
- Rebuilding when just changing source code should be fast as dependencies shouldn't be fetched
- Adding a new dependency should just fetch that dependency rather than fetching or linking all node_modules again
- Build native modules (e.g canvas) once, and once they are built they shouldn't be built again across packages
- Unplugged/native modules should have their outputs hashed to try and enforce reproducibility
- When using workspaces, adding a dependency in another package (modifying the yarn.lock file) in the workspace shouldn't cause a different package to have to be rebuilt
- devDependencies shouldn't be included as references in the final runtime derivation, only dependencies

## Usage

Requires a Yarn version > 4 project using PnP linking (the default). Zero installs are not required, so it's recommended to just use the global cache when developing your project rather than storing dependencies in your repo.

yarnpnp2nix is currently tested with Yarn version 4.0.1.

- Install Yarn plugin in your project:
  ```
  yarn plugin import https://github.com/madjam002/yarnpnp2nix/raw/master/plugin/dist/plugin-yarnpnp2nix.js
  ```

- Run `yarn` to make sure all packages are installed and to automatically generate a `yarn-manifest.nix` for your project.

- Create a `flake.nix` if you haven't already for your project, add this repo (`yarnpnp2nix`) as an input (e.g `yarnpnp2nix.url = github:madjam002/yarnpnp2nix;`)

- See [test/flake.nix](./test/flake.nix) for an example on how to create Nix derivations for Yarn packages using `mkYarnPackagesFromManifest`.

## Quick examples

Setting a build command for a package:

```nix
mkYarnPackagesFromManifest {
    yarnManifest = import ./workspace/yarn-manifest.nix;
    packageOverrides = {
        "my-package@workspace:packages/my-package".build = ''
            // Any custom build logic here
        '';
    };
};
```

Fixing a hash mismatch:

```nix
mkYarnPackagesFromManifest {
    yarnManifest = import ./workspace/yarn-manifest.nix;
    packageOverrides = {
        "my-package@workspace:packages/my-package".outputHash = "sha512-4pNZfI6GbsEsBySIs+gK98AGZhWf9QZ3SLytsWIzLnCeJYt2ma6qVK5Gk4TSHsUOmSjqUX8seBCKBBL7f1pvTQ==";
    };
};
```

## Other notes

Known caveats:
- Initial build can be a bit slow as each dependency is a separate derivation and needs to be fetched from the package registry. Still, a sample project with a couple of thousand dependencies (!!) only takes a couple of minutes to build all of the dependency derivations. Make sure you have enough parallelism in your `nix build` (either using the `-j` argument or setting your Nix config appropriately)
- Patched packages with localy stored patches need to have their revision strings updated to use relative paths instead of the default `~/` prefix

    For example, to fix a revision of a package stored in `packages/my-package` (relative to the workspace root), update the revision as such:
```diff
- "next": "patch:next@npm%3A13.2.1#~/.yarn/patches/next-npm-13.2.1-585715321e.patch",
+ "next": "patch:next@npm%3A13.2.1#../../.yarn/patches/next-npm-13.2.1-585715321e.patch",
```

Possible future improvements:
- When adding a Yarn package, copy it straight into the nix store rather than a Yarn cache in the users home directory
- ...and run postinstall/install builds from within Nix by defaulting Yarn to --ignore-scripts
